# To-Do-List (Not Quite Doing the To-Do Yet!)

This is a To Do List....but it isn't working ðŸ˜Œ, I used an array to implement storage for this due to being limited to use html, css and vanilla JS.

Work on the following issues:
- The styles are a bit rebellious and arenâ€™t working as intended.
- Sprinkle in a few effects for the buttons and tasks to make interactions feel satisfying.
- Implement addition of tasks in the array.
- When the session ends, itâ€™s as if my To-Do List suffers from short-term memory lossðŸ’”. Store the tasks in Local Storage so they persist even after refreshing the page.
- Complete Routes logic.

# Installation
- Download the zip file and extract the folder.
- Go to the directory of the folder and run # npm install.
- Run the code using # node index.js.
- Access the site by going to http://localhost:3000/
