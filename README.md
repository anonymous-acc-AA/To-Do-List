# To-Do-List (Not Quite Doing the To-Do Yet!)

This is a To Do List...but it isn't working ðŸ˜Œ. I used HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS for implementing this, I also used routes for handling POST and DELETE requests. Array based storage was used to store the tasks but they vanish after closing the page.

Help me make these changes to the To-Do List:
- The styles are a bit rebellious and arenâ€™t working as intended.
- Sprinkle in a few effects for the buttons and tasks to make interactions feel satisfying.
- Implement addition of tasks in the array.
- When the session ends, itâ€™s as if my To-Do List suffers from short-term memory lossðŸ’”. Store the tasks in Local Storage so they persist even after refreshing the page.
- Complete Routes logic.

# Installation
- Download the zip file and extract the folder.
- Go to the directory of the folder and run # npm install.
- Run the code using # node index.js.
- Access the site by going to http://localhost:3000/ after running the above command.
