# To-Do-List (Not Quite Doing the To-Do Yet!)

This is a To Do List...but it isn't working ðŸ˜Œ. I used HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS for implementing this, I also used routes for handling POST and DELETE requests. Array based storage was used to store the tasks but they vanish after closing the page.

# Features:

- Add task
- Mark the completion of task
- Delete the tasks

# Installation
- Download the zip file and extract the folder.
- Go to the directory of the folder and run # npm install.
- Run the code using # node index.js.
- Access the site by going to http://localhost:3000/ after running the above command.
